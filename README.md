# StepSetHome

The application uses Geofencing API and Google Maps API to check whether user is at home or not after fixed interval of time if yes then points are awarded else not awarded.

Technologies used :

* Java
* Geofencing API
* Google Maps API
* Android

##### Note: The application might give unexpected result related to wrong coins update. This is occuring due to no pending transitions intents generated by the geofecning api even after gps spoofing. So update gui and do spoofing mutliple times for good results.
