# StepSetHome

The application uses Geofencing API and Google Maps API to check whether user is at home or not after fixed interval of time if yes then points are awarded else not awarded.

Technologies used :

* Java
* Geofencing API
* Google Maps API
* Android

##### Note: 
The application might give unexpected result related to wrong coins update or wrong timer update. This is occuring due to no pending transitions intents generated by the geofecning api even after gps spoofing. So update gui and do spoofing mutliple times for good results. Give pause between each transition of screen.

##### Note:
The application can be improved if not using geofencing api because service gives update about the user location with delays and not at all sometimes. Using difference of the current location and previous location of user should used to check whether user is in the geofence or not. 

##### Issues:
Pertains with some devices like mine. That might be the reson for the aforementioned notes. Refer https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53631565/android-geofencing-not-triggering-in-some-mobile-like-oneplus-xiaomi-etc
